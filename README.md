# ClassRoster
The goal of this project from my Scripting and Programming - Applications course was to develop a student data management system using C++. 
The key objectives of the project were to construct a class structure for managing student and roster data, 
extract student data from a provided dataset, and implement fundamental data validation and error handling procedures. 
The project involved utilizing skills such as C++ programming, class design, and data manipulation.
